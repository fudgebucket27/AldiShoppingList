# AldiShoppingList

This app scrapes the ALDI API for the Thuringowa store and stores the product info into a SQLite DB. The web app is .NET MVC with some Javascript.

To modify it for your needs, you'll want to find your stores service point id and it's product category codes. I'll make this configurable in a future release.
